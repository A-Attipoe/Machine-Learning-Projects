This is a repository of some of my machine learning projects
## Predicting Insurance Charges
CSV files used : insurance.csv, validation_dataset.csv.
CSV file with output : validation_data_with_predictions.csv
### Project Description
In this project I stepped into the role of a Data Scientist at a leading Health Insurance company, where your task is to build a model that predicts customer charges.
### Tasks
1. Cleaned the dataset
2. Developed a regression model using the insurance.csv dataset to predict charges.
3. Evaluated the model's accuracy with the R-Squared Score. Then, applied the model to estimate predicted charges for unseen data in validation_dataset.csv.
4. The predictions were stored as a new column in the validation dataset called "predicted_charges", saving as a pandas DataFrame called validation_data. Negative values were handled by replacing them with the minimum basic charge, set at 1000.

 ## Predictive Modeling for Agriculture
 CSV files used : soil_measures.csv
 ### Project Description
 A farmer reached out to me seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures;
• Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
• Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
• Potassium content ratio in the soil
• pH value of the soil
Using supervised machine learning, I dived into the dataset to help a farmer decide the best feature for accurately predicting the crop
