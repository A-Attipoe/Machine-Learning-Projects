## Predicting Insurance Charges
CSV files used : insurance.csv, validation_dataset.csv
CSV file with output : validation_data_with_predictions.csv
### Project Description
In this project I stepped into the role of a Data Scientist at a leading Health Insurance company, where your task is to build a model that predicts customer charges.
### Tasks
1. Cleaned the dataset
2. Developed a regression model using the insurance.csv dataset to predict charges.
3. Evaluated the model's accuracy with the R-Squared Score. Then, applied the model to estimate predicted charges for unseen data in validation_dataset.csv.
4. The predictions were stored as a new column in the validation dataset called "predicted_charges", saving as a pandas DataFrame called validation_data. Negative values wre handled by replacing them with the minimum basic charge, set at 1000.
